Interfaces in Unseal
====================

.. contents:: Contents

Unseal wants to provide simple and intuitive interfaces for exploring
large language models.

At its core it relies on a combination of Streamlit and PySvelte.

Native interfaces
====================

Unseal comes with several native interfaces that are ready to use out of the box.

All the pre-built interfaces are available in the ``unseal.interface.plain_interfaces`` package.
